            <h3>You Wouldn't Buy Shoes Without Knowing your Size</h3>
            <p>Many marketing services are "cookie cutter" solutions: they offer a certain number of generic links, a certain number of generic blog posts, a certain number of generic social media posts, and so on.</p>
            <p>Without a coherent plan of what you want to achieve and how you plan to achieve it, most of these services will be completely inappropriate to your practice. It's as vague as buying "a pair of shoes" without knowing your measurements or style.</p>
