        <h2>Customisation Options</h2>
        <p>Unlike many agencies, <strong>I do not use pre-built templates or visual website builders</strong>, all of which can create slow, insecure and difficult-to-edit websites.  I'm a "real" designer and programmer and code everything myself, so you can mix and match ideas from different themes, or <strong>I can custom code anything at all that you want</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you want to be able to <strong>update your content yourself</strong>, I can build the facility to edit any of the text on your website from your user interface. For bigger tweaks, my hosting service (1 year free with all packages) also includes up to 30 minutes of developer time per month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="contentbox">
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">How much customisation do I get?</h3>
            <p>All websites are custom built just for you. I'm a professional coder so there's no design I can't create. I am to create a unique site that reflects you and your practice perfectly. If you've seen anything you like on another website I can code that for you too.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Will I Have to Pay for Hosting?</h3>
            <p>All my websites come with one year's hosting completely free, after that my hosting service is £20/month or £200/year. If you want to move to a different host, I'll provide you with everything you need to get your site set up on your new host.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">How Much Support do I Get?</h3>
            <p>While you are using my hosting services I provide unlimited support on any aspect of your website. From setting up your email, updating your blog, integrating your social media, checking your user statistics or any other question, I'm here to help.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can I edit my own site?</h3>
            <p>Yes you can.  I don't use drag-and-drop or visual editors but I will code into your site the fuctionality to edit any text you like.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Will I be on Google?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I will submit your website to Google for indexing. With the marketing package we'll carry out an SEO review to see what your potential patients are actually searching for, and optimise the site for those search terms.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Are there any hidden costs?</h3>
            <p>Nope. Stock photography, hosting and support are all included and you have 30 minutes developer time a month for any tweaks. Once your website is built you would only need to pay extra to make substantial design changes.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Do I need photos?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The images on your site are the images your patients will have of you and your practice. I highly recommend booking a photographer for half a day and doing a professional photoshoot, it will be worth it in the long run. Stock imagery is included.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Do I get a blog?</h3>
            <p>Yes, unless you don't want one. Blogging is a great way to promote your practice, even if you only post once or twice a year, so I encourage everyone to have one.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can you set up my social media accounts?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I will set you up social media accounts on up to 3 platforms, with a uniform design and branding, and link them to your website.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can you do custom code and advanced features?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I can code anything. If you've seen a feature on another website that you want I can do it. Talk to me and we'll discuss your ideas.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">What payment options are available?</h3>
            <p>I take a 25% deposit before beginning your project. The balance is due on completion and can be spread over 2 equal monthly payments (subject to approval). If you're a recent graduate you can spread the payments over 4 months.</p>
