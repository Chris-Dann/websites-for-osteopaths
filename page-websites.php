        <h2>Customisation Options</h2>
        <p>Unlike many agencies, <strong>we do not use pre-built templates or visual website builders</strong>, all of which can create slow, insecure and difficult-to-edit websites.  We are "real" designers and programmers who code everything ourselves, so you can mix and match ideas from different themes, or <strong>we can custom code anything at all that you want</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you want to be able to <strong>update your content yourself</strong>, we can build the facility to edit any of the text on your website from your user interface. For bigger tweaks, our hosting service (1 year free with all packages) also includes up to 30 minutes of developer time per month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="contentbox">
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">How much customisation do I get?</h3>
            <p>Loads! We start with one of our basic templates, but we aim to create a unique site that reflects you and your practice perfectly. We're also professional coders, so there's nothing we can't create, and if you've seen something you like on another website we can do the same for you.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Will I Have to Pay for Hosting?</h3>
            <p>All our packages come with one year's hosting completely free, after that our hosting service is £20/month or £200/year. If you want to move to a different host, we will provide you with everything you need to get your site set up on your new host.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">How Much Support do I Get?</h3>
            <p>While you are using our hosting services we provide unlimited support on any aspect of your website. From setting up your email, updating your blog, integrating your social media, checking your user statistics or any other question, we're here to help.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can I edit my own site?</h3>
            <p>Yes you can.  We do not use drag-and-drop or visual editors but we will code into your site the fuctionality to edit any text you like.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Will I be on Google?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Yes you will.</p>
                <p>With the pro package we will optimise your site for the SEO terms you specify, carry out a Technical SEO check and submit your site to Google for indexing.</p>
                <p>With the Pro + Marketing package we go quite a bit further, first carrying out an SEO audit to identify niche opportunities in your area and build your website architecture to target these niches. We will then take a proactive approach to building links into your website, moving you up the search rankings for your chosen terms.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Are there any hidden costs?</h3>
            <p>The only things you might need to pay extra for are a professional photoshoot if you choose to have one, and any advanced custom coding. Stock photography and hosting is all included, and day-to-day updating and small edits of your website, support is all included. Once your website is built you would only need to pay extra to make substantial changes.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">What about photos?</h3>
            <p>We need quality images to build you a quality website and will need photos of you and your practice. Remember these photos are the image your web visitors will have of you. Although it's not mandatory, we recommend you do a photoshoot at your practice with a professional photographer, and offer £50 off this with our Pro + Marketing package.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Do I get a blog?</h3>
            <p>Yes, unless you don't want one. Blogging is a great way to promote your practice, even if you only post once or twice a year, so we encourage everyone to have one. See our free guide on promoting your practice by blogging.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can you set up my social media accounts?</h3>
            <p>Yes, with any package we will set you up social media accounts on up to 3 platforms, with a uniform design and branding, and link them back to your website.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">Can you do custom code and advanced features?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we can code anything. If you've seen a feature on another website that you want we can do it. Please note custom coding may incur an additional charge, speak to us and let us know your ideas.</p>
            <h3 class="faquestion faq-closed">What payment options are available?</h3>
            <p>You can pay interest-free in 4 monthly installments (subject to a credit check). If you've graduated in a recognised osteopathy course within the last 2 years, you can spread the payments over 8 months instead of 4.</p>
