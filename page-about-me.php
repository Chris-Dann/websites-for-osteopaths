            <h3>Osteopathy and Me</h3>
            <p>I first visited an osteopath about 20 years ago, I’d had back pains since my teens and someone recommended I go to an osteopath - I didn’t even know what an osteopath was!</p>
            <p>My osteopath diagnosed my posture problems as a result of my childhood asthma and manipulated me back into shape. I’ve since found that a bit of daily yoga keeps my back straight, but I’ve been going back ever since, with all sorts of complaints over the years including plantar fasciitis and calf problems from running, a torn rotator cuff from boxing, and RSI that hurt from my fingertip right up to my ear.</p>
            <h3>Why Websites for Osteopaths?</h3>
            <p>I’ve always built websites and marketed my own businesses and projects, but only started building websites full-time a few years ago. I created websites for osteopaths because I’ve seen osteopaths who have incredible skills and knowledge but are let down by their online presence or not knowing how to market their practice.</p>
            <p>That’s a terrible shame when I think of how much osteopathy has helped me over the years. Before I first went to my osteopath I didn’t know I could get help for my problem at all. These days I could google my problem and find a practitioner who explains the possible causes and treatments of my problem online, and makes it easy for me to book an appointment. All you need is a good website and web strategy.</p>
            <p>And that’s where I come in! I can give you a professional web presence, support and digital marketing to help your practice take off. Let's talk and see if we're a good fit to work together.</p>
